# Fallout SNPCs Revamp

This is an open-beta for my revamped Fallout SNPCs. These SNPCs have been recreated from the ground up ever since their initial release back in 2015-2016.

To install, place the contents of the rar file in your "/Steam/steamapps/common/Garrysmod/garrysmod/addons/" folder.

Be sure you have the latest version of VJ Base!
