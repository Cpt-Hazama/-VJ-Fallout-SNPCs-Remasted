##This will not work unless you download the models too!

These SNPCs have been recreated from the ground up ever since their initial release back in 2015-2016.

To install, place the contents of the rar file in your "/Steam/steamapps/common/Garrysmod/garrysmod/addons/" folder.

**Be sure you have the latest version of VJ Base!**
